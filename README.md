# PureScript Resources

This is a collection of notes and links to resources to learn and use PureScript as generally recommended by me. This is all biased information. Think of it as "awesome-how-to-purescript" that isn't just a link farm.

This guide contains a lot of 🌶️. If you'd like to have something changed or explained more, make a PR or an issue.

There is another resources page out there that you might look at here: <https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-jordans-reference>
