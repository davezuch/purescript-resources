# Psc-Package or Spago

I use Psc-Package, but I realize it might not be what people readily want. Maybe Spago will help: <https://github.com/spacchetti/spago>

See the docs for Psc-Package here <https://psc-package.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

For easy installation, you might try <https://www.npmjs.com/package/psc-package-bin-simple>.

## Spacchetti

I have a Dhall-based package set for Psc-Package that I actively use and base my work and home projects on. See the docs <https://spacchetti.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

## With Nix

I have put together a Psc-Package2Nix project here: <https://github.com/justinwoo/psc-package2nix>
