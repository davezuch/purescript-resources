PureScript Resources
============================

**DEPRECATED: this content will be moved to GitHub for ease of maintenance: `https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-resources`

-------

This is a collection of notes and links to resources to learn and use PureScript as generally recommended by me. This is all biased information. Think of it as "awesome-how-to-purescript" that isn't just a link farm.

This guide contains a lot of üå∂Ô∏è. If you'd like to have something changed or explained more, make a PR or an issue.

There is another resources page out there that you might look at here: `https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-jordans-reference <https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-jordans-reference>`_
