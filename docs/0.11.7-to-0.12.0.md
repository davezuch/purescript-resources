# 0.11.7 to 0.12.0

There are very few changes needed to be made to upgrade to 0.12.0.

Below from <https://gist.github.com/justinwoo/c28327abe623c117e938a0b471b2e2a2>

----------

There are some changes you will need to make for most applications to be upgraded to PureScript 0.12. With some usage of editor commands, you should be able to convert any 20K LOC codebase in less than an hour.

## Libraries

* Remove `eff`, install `effect`
* Remove `dom` and `dom-*`, use `web-dom` and such from [purescript-web](https://github.com/purescript-web). Use type holes (`?whatmethod`) to discover new APIs
* Remove `maps`, install `ordered-collections` for Map/Set/etc. and `foreign-object` for `StrMap`

## Changes

* `Eff (fx :: # Type) a` -> `Effect a`
* `Aff (fx :: # Type) a` -> `Aff a`
* `Control.Monad.Effect` -> `Effect`
* `id` -> `identity`
* `Data.Record` -> `Record`
* `Data.StrMap` -> `Foreign.Object`
* `Data.Foreign` -> `Foreign`

## Updating libraries

* Use a newer package set or use `ncu -uam bower` via [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates)
* If you want a package set that is actively maintained by me, see <https://github.com/spacchetti/spacchetti/releases>

## General

* Use `psc-package build -d` or `pulp build --src-path some-empty-folder` if you want to only build dependencies first (you should)
